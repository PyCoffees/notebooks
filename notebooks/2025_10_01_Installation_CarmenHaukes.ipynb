    "## Differences between Compiler, Interpreter, and IDEs\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we need to understand what Python actually is. To do this, it is helpful to highlight the differences between these three concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Compiler:** Translates the whole code (e.g., into a .exe file) into machine language **before running** (e.g., C, C++). Execution is fast, but errors appear only after compilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interpreter:** Executes code **line by line** in real time (e.g., Python). Easy to test and debug, but usually slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** A workspace with an editor, debugger, and terminal (e.g., VS Code). Helps write and organize code, but doesn‚Äôt execute it by itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: Visual Studio and VS Code are different tools. For Python, VS Code is usually the better choice.*\n"

    "### 1.1 Introduction\n",
    "Python is a general‚Äêpurpose, high‚Äêlevel, interpreted programming language\n",
    "\n",
    "- *General‚Äêpurpose*: Many applications (in our case astrophysics)\n",
    "- *High‚Äêlevel*: Abstract data structures, doing more with less code.\n",
    "- *Interpreted*: No need to compile.\n",

    "Python was created by Guido van Rossum in the Netherlands.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python 1.0:** Released in 1991. Introduced basic data types, functions, and exception handling.\n",
    "- **Python 2.0:** Released in 2000. Added list comprehensions, garbage collection, and Unicode support.\n",
    "- **Python 3.0:** Released in 2008. Not backwards-compatible with Python 2.x. Introduced print() function, new string handling, and better library consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3.X is the current version and actively maintained, but Python 2.x remained popular for many years and was officially supported until 2020.  \n",

    "- Download the installer from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n",

    "- Comes with Python + many scientific libraries + environments.\n",
