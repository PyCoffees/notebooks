# Notebooks
Repository of Jupyter notebooks from PyCoffees at CAB. PyCoffees@CAB are informal sessions taking place at the Villafranca library (at ESA premisses in Madrid) among members of the Astrophysics Department of the Center for Astrobiology. They are organised by Staff and PhD students and aim at sharing knowledge about `Python` tips and modules that are generally useful in Astrophysics data analysis.

All notebooks are in English and extensively commented. They will be stored as both `.ipynb` and `.html` files.

### An Introduction to the Pandas Python Library
[![Jupyter Book Badge](https://jupyterbook.org/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PyCoffees/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/2024_10_02_IntroPandas_DavidORyan.ipynb) &nbsp; [![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-white?style=flat-square&logo=html5&logoColor=white&color=%23E34F26
)](https://github.com/PyCoffees/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/html/2024_10_02_IntroPandas_DavidORyan.html)

Many of you will have heard of `Pandas` before. This is a data handlying `Python` library, which utilises a Tabular format of data structure called a DataFrame. This is a very logical, and easy way to keep track of data, apply functions to that data and append more data to it. In this Notebook, I will demonstrate:

1. How to import a CSV file, and do some initial exploration of the data.
2. How to merge two DataFrames.
3. How to make plots directly from DataFrame columns.
4. How to apply a simple function to a DataFrame.
5. How to apply an advanced function to a DataFrame.

### Astroquery and its secrets
[![Jupyter Book Badge](https://jupyterbook.org/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PyCoffees/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/2024_10_30_Astroquery_CarlosCifuentes.ipynb) &nbsp; [![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-white?style=flat-square&logo=html5&logoColor=white&color=%23E34F26
)](https://github.com/PyCoffees/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/html/2024_10_30_Astroquery_CarlosCifuentes.html)

Many tasks depend on retrieving information from large public databases that store observations, catalogues, and published studies. While manual downloads are sometimes possible, automated data retrieval is often the most efficient, secure, and reproducible approach. However, the diversity of databases, with different access protocols and formats, presents a challenge. In this Pycoffee we learn how `Astroquery` can help simplifying this process, providing a Pythonic way to interact with numerous astronomical databases in a unified manner.

### Understanding `self` in Python Classes
[![Jupyter Book Badge](https://jupyterbook.org/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PyCoffees/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/2025_03_12_self_CarmenHaukes.ipynb) &nbsp; [![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-white?style=flat-square&logo=html5&logoColor=white&color=%23E34F26
)](https://github.com/PyCoffees/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/html/2025_03_12_self_CarmenHaukes.html)

This PyCoffee explains the use of `self` in `Python` classes. It highlights that `self` allows accessing, storing, and updating instance attributes, making it easier to reuse methods without redefining values. It also emphasizes that `self` represents the class itself, enabling attribute updates and maintaining code consistency. Finally, it covers how `self` facilitates interaction between classes, allowing information reuse without code duplication. The conclusion is that `self` is essential for organizing and structuring code efficiently, as long as clear and consistent naming is maintained.

### Calculating Moving Averages
[![Jupyter Book Badge](https://jupyterbook.org/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PyCoffees/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/2025_05_07_MovingAverages_GonzaloCarracedo.ipynb) &nbsp; [![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-white?style=flat-square&logo=html5&logoColor=white&color=%23E34F26
)](https://github.com/PyCoffees/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/html/2025_05_07_MovingAverages_GonzaloCarracedo.html)

Calculating moving averages is a simple, well known denoising technique that works for band-limited signals. Naive implementations rely on `NumPy`'s convolve() function which works well for small window sizes, but grows linearly in time as the kernel length increases. In this tutorial, we explore and benchmark three different ways of doing the same operation and draw conclusions on which one is better in different scenarios.
